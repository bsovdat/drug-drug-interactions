# Predicting Drug-Drug Interactions with GraphSAGE and JK-Net

## Overview

This project, a final submission for Stanford University's [CS224W class](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/), demonstrates the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), specifically GraphSAGE combined with JK-Net, in predicting drug-drug interactions. Developed by Blaž Erzar, Bernard Sovdat, and Klemen Vovk, the project is rooted in the complex yet fascinating domain of GNNs, offering insights into real-world applications.

## Background

The interplay of different medications within the human body can have significant implications, ranging from reduced efficacy to unintended side effects. Understanding these drug-drug interactions is crucial for healthcare professionals and patients managing multiple medications.

## Approach

Our project leverages GraphSAGE and JK-Net, two prominent GNN architectures, to model and predict potential interactions between drugs. We assume readers have a foundational understanding of machine learning and deep learning, with practical experience in PyTorch for following the programming examples.

## Project Structure

The Jupyter notebook includes:

- An introduction to the problem domain and the relevance of drug-drug interactions.
- A detailed exploration of GraphSAGE and JK-Net architectures.
- Implementation examples using PyTorch.
- Analysis and discussion of the results.

## Requirements

- A working knowledge of PyTorch.
- Familiarity with machine learning and deep learning concepts.

## Acknowledgements

We extend our gratitude to the instructors and peers in the CS224W class at Stanford for their guidance and insights throughout this project.
